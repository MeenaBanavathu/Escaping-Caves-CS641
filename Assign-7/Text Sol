Give a detailed description of the cryptanalysis used to figure out the password. ( Use Latex wherever required. If your solution is not readable, you will lose marks. If necessary the file upload option in this question must be used TO SHARE IMAGES ONLY.)

We used the above commands, which led us to a panel and the following is written on it with a list of numbers.
"You must be wondering about these numbers. These are hash values of your password
which is made of letters between 'f' and 'u'. Also, the letters in the password are
in alphabetic order. For hashing, your password is viewed as a sequence
of numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_m in the field F_{127}. The ith number of the hashed
sequence equals x_1^{i-1} + x_2^{i-1} + ... + x_m^{i-1}. As you can see, there are 32 such numbers for i = 1 to 32."

We tried using the hashing method to find the message.
Given P : [23 62 124 37 73 104 5 47 97 60 8 33 39 97 121 38 30 126 60 70 123 113 38 90 50 115 36 118 75 55 36 43]
Let it be termed as P_0, P_1, P_2, ... , P_m.
We need to decrypt the message XX which is in the format as x_0, x_1, x_2, ... , x_m
The formula used is P_i = sum_{j=1}^{m}(x_j)^i.
From the formula , P_0 = 23 and P_0 = sum_{j=1}^{m}(x_j)^0 
Thus, we get m = 23 which indicates the length of the message is 23. 

Now as we know that P_i = sum_{j=1}^{m}(x_j)^i and for iâ‰¥0 denote by e_i(x_1, ..., x_m) the elementary symmetric polynomial (sum of all distinct products of i distinct variables)
From this we get
e_0(x_1, x_2,..., x_m) = 1
e_1(x_1, x_2,..., x_m) = x_1+x_2+...+x_m
e_2(x_1, x_2,..., x_m) = sum_{1 \le i \lt j \le n}(x_i)(x_j)
Continuing this we get
e_m(x_1, x_2,..., x_m) = x_1x_2...x_m
e_0(x_1, x_2,..., x_m) = 0
k>m

What was the final command used to clear this level?
